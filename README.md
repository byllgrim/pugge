# pugge
Multiple choice program for the terminal (WIP).

Questions and answers are specified in a very simple plain-text format.
Multiple files may be loaded and randomized.
Try the 'demo.mc' file or make your own.

## Why?
The need arose because of a multiple choice test at university.
I want a simple format and minimalistic interface.
Also, I wanted to hone my C skills.

## The name
Pronounce it how you want.
You may say **pug-e**, like the dog breed pug and the character Wall-E.
The norwegian pronounciation is almost like **poo-guh**.
