# pugge
Multiple-choice game for the terminal.

Q&A are specified in a very simple plain-text format.
Try 'demo.pugge' or make your own.

## Why?
The need arose because of a multiple choice test at university.
I want a simple format and minimalistic interface.

## The name
You may pronounce it **pug-e**, like the dog breed pug and the character Wall-E.
The norwegian pronounciation is almost like **poo-ga**, poo as in shit and ga
as in gay.
